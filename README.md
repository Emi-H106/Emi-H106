##   :wave: About me 

Hi! My name is Emi, and I’m currently studying the Foundations program at Holberton School.
Next year, I will continue my journey by specializing in Cybersecurity, as I am deeply interested in protecting systems, networks, and data.<br>

My goal is to build a career in cybersecurity, where I can contribute to creating safer digital environments. I’m motivated to keep learning, developing my technical skills, and applying them to real-world challenges.
